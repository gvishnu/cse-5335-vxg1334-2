—> External Data Source: 

	The external data source used to populate my Heroku data sources includes the 
famous iris database. It consists of the dimensions or pixel values of various flower
photos. 
	
	This data is taken and modified from “https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=8&ved=0CE0QFjAHahUKEwiNq-Kq-5bJAhUO1WMKHdLnCXQ&url=http%3A%2F%2Ffaculty.smu.edu%2Ftfomby%2Feco5385%2Fdata%2FIris.xls&usg=AFQjCNEmu-hW7i3S23RHamjeXwgjoWh-Ow&sig2=EgdA4rTh5lsc0uvADHsg0w&bvm=bv.107763241,d.cGc&cad=rja”

—> The Heroku toolbelt commands to execute the scripts: 

	1) git add .  
	2) git commit -m “statement”
	3) git push Heroku master 
	4) heroku run bash
	5) node filename.js

—> The program part which asked us to create scripts to populate data to datasources,
querying a single element based on its primary unique key and to select at least 2 
elements based on some non-primary-key attribute of the data is a bit logical but 
easy and interested to solve. 

—> The access, authentication and deployment of Heroku data sources and Heroku apps
are a bit time taking for understanding the framework which is a new technology to me. But it is a challenging and good source to use different types of data sources 
depending on our usage.
